# gnome-emoji-buckets
Emoji buckets shell extension for the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop.

## About
This is a GNOME shell extension that provides buckets of emojis. Simply click on the emoji of your choice and it will be placed into your clipboard.


## Installation
First, make sure you have a font that supports emoji. This uses [EmojiOne](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione) with [Noto Emoji](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) and [Symbola](http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/) as fallback so be sure to install at least one of these fonts.

You can install this extension by downloading a released version and extracting the files into the following directory.

```
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/emoji_buckets@harlemsquirrel
```

Log out or restart the GNOME shell to make it available in GNOME Tweak. Note that on Wayland restarting the GNOME shell is not working as of 3.22.2.
